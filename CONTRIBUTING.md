# Contribution guidelines

This program uses scratchattach to get the variables and set them, so you need familiarity with Python and scratchattach to contribute.

## What to contribute?

Here are the types of contribution we welcome:

- Contributions that fix an issue.
- Add a planned feature.
- QOL improvements

We may also merge a pull request containing new features if it is stable, improves the program, and doesn't interfere with other features.

## Styling Suggestions

- Use 4 space indentation in code to help it make it more readable.
- Add short, descriptive, and clear descriptions for functions you make. This makes it easier for someone to understand exactly what the function does.

## Making the pull request

You may want to enable editing for maintainers to allow maintainers to improve the code before merging the pull request instead of changing it after they just merged the pull request.

You want the pull request's title to be as descriptive as possible in the fewest words possible.

When you type the request, you have to mention what issue it fixes (We recommend you also make an issue about the thing you want to add/remove/fix to make discussion easier), what changes you exactly made, and in which environment you tested the changes you made.
